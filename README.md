### Abstract 
 
 Student stress management at the undergraduate
 level is a significant issue in the educational world. Therefore,
 this stress is a challenging issue that needs to be dealt with. As
 higher educational requirements stack up and their challenges
 grow, most students struggle to keep the required balance
 between their studies and preparation. This study establishes a
 deeper investigation of stress management among undergraduate
 students using machine-learning algorithms to identify factors
 contributing to stress and provide solutions. The research aims
 to illuminate the fundamental causes and health implications
 of stress for students. Through surveys and questionnaires, the
 study categorizes stress stages, identifying patterns and enabling
 the use of new stress management strategies. The findings are
 used to address concerns shared by undergraduate students and
 determine interventions to help them cope effectively which aim
 to provide students with the strength, knowledge, resources, and
 support needed to manage stress effectively and live a fulfilling
 life during their university years and future years. The findings
 will be used to develop policies and programs backed by science
 to ensure emotional and academic success for students.
